== Discussion
- Extreme discipline is needed to do TDD right.
- Not useful for trivial methods like getters/setter or toString
- It forces you to write code more modular
- Refactoring is easier
- It forces you to use a better code style
- It helps you to clarify the requirements of a method
- It won't guarantee *good* unit tests
- If not everybody in the team maintains unit tests TDD won't work
